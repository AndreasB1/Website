                        <h1> About Me </h1>
                        Born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, I am a passionate geomatics engineer-in-training with a strong work ethic and attention to detail. I hold a Bachelor of Science from the University of Calgary and I am currently pursuing my master’s degree at ETH Zürich in Switzerland. Ever since I started studying, my goal has been to expand my knowledge and skills so that I can better cope with the geomatics challenges of the future. I truly believe that geomatics has a lot to offer and is becoming increasingly more important in all kinds of industries and applications. Whether it’s guiding autonomous vehicles in urban environments or carefully landing spacecraft on Mars, the benefits derived from geomatics engineering can be found all around us. From defining property boundaries to location-based services on our smartphones, geomatics is an exciting high-tech field that we encounter and rely on every day without even being aware of it. This is what fascinates me most: how it is widespread but at the same time relatively unheard of for many people.

                        <h1> What Exactly is Geomatics? </h1>
                        Great question, I’m glad you asked. In a nutshell, it’s the science of measurement, mapping, and managing geospatial information among other things. Historically, it was perhaps better known as surveying engineering but lately, given the rapid evolution of technology, geomatics has grown to be so much more. The field is comprised of many subdisciplines including surveying, cartography, photogrammetry, geodesy, satellite positioning (GNSS, GPS, etc.), remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) to name only a few examples. Anything related to location and measurement generally falls under the umbrella of geomatics. Professional geomatics engineers are essential to any project team as a result of their unique skill set. They are often in high demand given their ability to properly assess measurement errors and convert between different coordinate systems.
